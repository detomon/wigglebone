# WiggleBone Plugin for Godot Engine

Add jiggle physics to your **Skeleton**. The node is used like a **BoneAttachment** but influences the bones custom pose to react to (animated or global) motion of the **Skeleton**.

## Bone Name

Selects which bone should be used. Shows a list of bone names from the parent **Skeleton**.

## Bone Properties (`Properties`)

Properties are stored in a separate **WiggleProperties** resource type. This way, bone properties can be reused and shared between multiple bones.

### Mass Center

The mass center is attached to the bone's end and determines how motion and gravity influences the motion. As there is no way to get the bone length automatically, this point has to be set manually. Usually its along the Y-axis of the bone.

### Gravity

The force pulling at the mass center.

### Stiffness

This is the bones tendency to return to its original pose. The higher the value the stronger the pull.

### Damping

Reduces the bones motion. The higher the value the slower it moves in general.

### Mode

Two different pose modes are supported:

`Rotation`

The bone rotates around its origin. The rotation angle can be limited with `Max Degrees` to a certain value but has an upper limit of 90Â° relative to the original pose.

`Dislocation`

The bone moves relative to its origin but without rotating. The distance can be limited to a certain value with `Max Distance`

## Constant Force (`Const Force`)

This applies a global constant force additionally to the gravity already set in **WiggleProperties** but per bone. This can be used to apply an impluse when only set for one frame.

## Functions

### `set_const_force(force: Vector3)`

Sets an additional global constant force.

### `apply_impulse(impulse: Vector3, global: bool = true)`

Adds a single impulse force for the next frame.

### `reset()`

Resets all forces. Can be used, for example, after "teleporting" the character (moving instantaneously a long distance) to prevent overshooting.

## Testing in Editor

A force can be applied to the bone to test the properties in the editor by dragging its handle. When selected, the handle appears at the bone's end when `Rotation` mode is used or at the root when `Dislocation` mode is used, respectively. Another way is to drag or rotate the **Skeleton** or one of its parents directly.
