# WiggleBone Plugin for Godot Engine

Add jiggle physics to your **Skeleton**. The node is used like a **BoneAttachment** but influences the bones custom pose to react to (animated or global) motion of the **Skeleton**.

## Enabled (`enabled`)

Enables or disables wiggling. When disabled, the bone returns to it's normal pose.

## Bone Name (`bone_name`)

Selects which bone should be used.

## Properties (`properties`)

Properties are stored in a separate **WiggleProperties** resource type. This way, bone properties can be reused and shared between multiple bones.

### Mass Center (`mass_center`)

The mass center is attached to the bone's end and determines how motion and gravity influences the motion. As there is no way to get the bone length automatically, this point has to be set manually. Usually its along the Y-axis of the bone.

### Gravity (`gravity`)

The force pulling at the mass center.

### Stiffness (`stiffness`)

This is the bones tendency to return to its original pose. The higher the value the stronger the pull.

### Damping (`damping`)

Reduces the bones motion. The higher the value the slower it moves in general.

### Mode (`mode`)

Two different pose modes are supported:

#### Rotation (`WiggleProperties.Mode.ROTATION`)

The bone rotates around its origin. The rotation angle can be limited with `Max Degrees` to a certain value but has an upper limit of 90Â° relative to the original pose.

#### Dislocation (`WiggleProperties.Mode.DISLOCATION`)

The bone moves relative to its origin but without rotating. The distance can be limited to a certain value with `Max Distance`

## Constant Force (`const_force`)

This applies a global constant force additionally to the gravity already set in **WiggleProperties**.

## Constant Local Force (`const_force_local`)

This applies a global constant force additionally to the gravity already set in **WiggleProperties** but relative to the bone's current pose.

## Functions

### `apply_impulse(impulse: Vector3, global: bool = true)`

Adds a single impulse force for the next frame. If `global` is `false`, the force is relative to the bone's pose.

### `reset()`

Resets all forces. Can be used, for example, after "teleporting" the character (moving instantaneously a long distance) to prevent overshooting.

## Testing in Editor

A force can be applied to the bone to test the properties in the editor by dragging its handle. When selected, the handle appears at the bone's end when `Rotation` mode is used or at the root when `Dislocation` mode is used, respectively. Another way is to drag or rotate the **Skeleton** or one of its parents directly.
